# TransportNetworkServers
The Transport Network Server Application is designed to simulate a public transportation network, specifically modeled on systems like Transperth. The project aims to provide a practical learning environment for understanding and implementing network protocols such as TCP, UDP, HTTP, and HTML, all within the context of a distributed server system.
